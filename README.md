Interview Questions and Answers
1. What inspired you to create this project?
# âœ… "The increasing incidents of harassment and violence against women inspired me to work on a proactive safety solution. I wanted to create a system that could immediately alert authorities, provide real-time evidence, and offer a physical deterrent."
2. How does the system capture and send images?
âœ… "The system uses OpenCV in Python to capture images from a webcam when the emergency switch is pressed. The image is then sent via email using an SMTP protocol, ensuring immediate documentation of the situation."
3. What protocols are used for sending images in your project?
âœ… "The project primarily uses the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to send images via email. Additionally, HTTP or MQTT protocols could be integrated for cloud-based image storage or real-time monitoring."
4. How does the shock mechanism work?
âœ… "We used a locally available mosquito bat, which generates a non-lethal high-voltage, low-current shock. When triggered via a relay circuit, it provides a temporary deterrent to an attacker."
5. What are the advantages of your system over existing safety apps?
âœ… *"Unlike mobile apps, which depend on manual activation and network availability, our system offers:
â€¢ Immediate action (buzzer + shock mechanism).
â€¢ Real-time photo capture and email alerts.
â€¢ No dependency on external services for real-time execution."*
6. How did you implement serial communication between Arduino and PC?
âœ… "We used the USB interface for serial communication. The Arduino reads the emergency switch input and sends data to the PC. The Python script continuously listens for input and triggers the camera and email functions."
7. What challenges did you face while developing this project?
âœ… "One challenge was ensuring real-time execution with minimal delay. We optimized the Python script to quickly capture images and send them. Another challenge was safely integrating the shock mechanism, ensuring it was effective but not harmful."
8. How can this project be improved in the future?
âœ… *"In future versions, we could:
â€¢ Add GPS tracking to send the victimâ€™s location.
â€¢ Use IoT cloud services for real-time monitoring.
â€¢ Integrate a voice command feature for activation without pressing a button."*

Project Explanation: Empowering Womenâ€™s Safety with Smart IoT Technology
1. Introduction
The primary goal of this project is to enhance women's safety using IoT and embedded systems. Unlike traditional mobile-based safety applications, this system provides real-time surveillance, immediate response, and a physical deterrent to threats.
The system integrates:
â€¢ Hardware components: Arduino, webcam, emergency switch, buzzer, relay, and a shock mechanism.
â€¢ Software technologies: Python (for image processing and email alerts), OpenCV (for camera functions), and Embedded C (for Arduino control).
2. Problem Statement
Womenâ€™s safety is a critical issue, and traditional methods such as mobile emergency alerts or hotlines have limitations: âœ… Dependence on network connectivity â€“ May fail in areas with poor signal. âœ… Delay in response â€“ Requires manual operation of apps or calling for help. âœ… No physical defense mechanism â€“ Cannot directly deter an attacker.
This project overcomes these limitations by using a hardware-based IoT solution that offers automatic actions in case of emergency.
3. System Overview and Working
The system is built around an Arduino microcontroller connected to a Python-installed PC. It includes the following key features:
(A) Real-time Image Capture & Email Alert
â€¢ When the emergency switch is pressed, the webcam captures an image of the attacker.
â€¢ The image is automatically sent via email to a pre-configured contact using SMTP protocol.
â€¢ This serves as evidence for authorities and helps in quick identification.
(B) Buzzer Alarm
â€¢ A loud buzzer is activated to attract public attention and deter the attacker.
â€¢ This increases the chances of receiving immediate help.
(C) Shock Mechanism (Non-lethal Defense)
â€¢ A relay-controlled mosquito bat delivers a high-voltage, low-current shock to temporarily disable the attacker.
â€¢ This provides time for the victim to escape.
(D) Communication Between Arduino and PC
â€¢ The Arduino and PC communicate via serial communication (USB interface).
â€¢ The Arduino detects the emergency switch press and sends a signal to the PC.
â€¢ The Python script listens for this signal, then triggers the webcam and email functions.
