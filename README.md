# Empowering-womens-safety
1.Introduction:-
"My project is titled Empowering Women’s Safety with Smart IoT Technology: A Robust Protection System. It is designed to enhance women's security using IoT technology, integrating hardware and software components to provide a quick response in emergency situations."<br>
2. Problem Statement:-
"Traditional safety measures like mobile apps and emergency hotlines often fail due to delays in response or lack of immediate defense mechanisms. There was a need for a more proactive and real-time solution."<br>
3. Proposed Solution:-
"We developed a smart protection system using an Arduino microcontroller and a Python-installed PC. The system includes:
▪ A webcam for real-time surveillance.
▪ A panic button (emergency switch) that, when pressed, triggers multiple safety actions.
▪ An image capture system that immediately sends a photo of the potential attacker to a preconfigured email.
▪ A buzzer alarm to draw attention and deter threats.
▪ A shock mechanism, using a mosquito bat, to temporarily disable the attacker."<br>
4. Implementation:-
"The system uses serial communication between the PC and Arduino. The Python program captures and sends images via email using OpenCV. The hardware components, including a relay and inverter, control the shock mechanism."<br>
5. Technologies Used:-
Hardware: Arduino, Webcam, Relay, Emergency Switch, Mosquito Bat (Shock Mechanism), Power Supply
Software: Python, OpenCV, Embedded C, Arduino IDE. <br>
6. Applications:-
"This system can be used in personal safety devices, smart wearables, public transportation, and workplace security."
